In a study comparing two treatments (which we typically label "treatment" and "control"), causal inferences are cleanest if the units receiving the treatment are comparable to those receiving the control.

Ignorable: means that we only need to consider observed pre-treatment predictors when considering comparability @gelman2006data . I dont recall this

Imbalance occurs if the distributions of

relevant pre-treatment variables differ for the treatment and control groups. Lack

of complete overlap occurs if there are regions in the space of relevant pre-treatment

variables where there are treated units but no controls, or controls but no treated

units.

Imbalance and lack of complete overlap are issues for causal inference largely

because they force us to rely more heavily on model specification and less on direct

support from the data.

When treatment and control groups are unbalanced, the simple comparison of

group averages, ¯y1−¯y0, is not, in general, a good estimate of the average treatment

effect. Instead, some analysis must be performed to adjust for pre-treatment

differences between the groups. Even when all the confounding covariates are measured (hence ignorability is satisfied), however, it can be difficult to properly control for them if the distributions

of the predictors are not similar across groups.

When treatment and control groups do not completely overlap, the data are inherently

limited in what they can tell us about treatment effects in the regions of

nonoverlap. No amount of adjustment can create direct treatment/control comparisons,

and one must either restrict inferences to the region of overlap, or rely on a

model to extrapolate outside this region.

Interactions larger main effects should check whats up. Yea but if several things have large main effects do you check the interactions for just those. Or does that mean you check to see what has an interaction with variable that have large main effects?

Models with interactions are often easier to interpret once you center the variables to some conveienent reference point such as it's mean. (andrew gelman hierarchcial)

## What to do when you cant interpret effects an though these were independent.

In other words..what is the deal with having multicollinearity i guess? This is also present at the conceptual level I guess. Especially with observational data damn thats a dangerous statement.
