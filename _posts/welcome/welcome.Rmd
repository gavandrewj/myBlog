title: "Multivariate Analysis"
description: |
  This section contains questions that use various multivariate techniques. Each problem explores the assumptions required to use the technique, performs exploratory analysis where possible and in some cases comment on the experimental design when it is available. In cases where the technique is not found to be appropriate the aim will be to suggest alternatives.
