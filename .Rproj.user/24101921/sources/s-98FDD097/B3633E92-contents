  We're gonna be doin all kinds of shit folks; anything but developing meaningful and rewarding relationships with my friends cause.. thats, not very 2020 is it now? NOOO!! We gotta keep that monster alive so we're exploring Multivariate Analysis. I hope you either learn something against your will or are implicated in a charity scheme associated with this blog which of course I'd never do, I have fascist friends.

Here is my vision and lifelong quote by ME, this guy, the author: 

I'm gonna trade this life for fortune and fame  
I'd even cut my hair and changed my name  
'Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars  
And live in hilltop houses, driving 15 cars  
The girls come easy, and the drugs come cheap  
We'll all stay skinny, 'cause we just won't eat  
And we'll hang out in the coolest bars  
In the V.I.P. with the movie stars  
Every good gold digger's gonna wind up there  
Every Playboy Bunny with her bleached blond hair and, well  
Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar  
Hmm, hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar  



This doesn't remind you of anything
