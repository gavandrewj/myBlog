Here is the vision and lifelong quote by **ME**, the author: 

*"I'm gonna trade this life for fortune and fame  
I'd even cut my hair and change my name"*  

and also by **THIs guy**:


*"Every good gold digger's gonna wind up there  
Every Playboy Bunny with her bleached blond hair"*  



This reminds you of nothing.
