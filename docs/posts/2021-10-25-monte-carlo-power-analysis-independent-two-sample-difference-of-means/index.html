<h1 id="motivation">Motivation</h1>
<p>I found it discouraging that a power analysis for a multinomial multiple logistic regression wasn’t readily accessible/available in the same vein as one could use the technique. Eventually I started to grasp why it might be difficult to distill the complexity of a dataset to a few much less one formula for a sample size.</p>
<p>This led me to favor simulations. Okay everything in stats is a simulation but that itself wasn’t evident to me for quite some time until I started diving into the Bayesian methods with respect to posterior predictive checks.</p>
<p>This is first a proof of exercise, hopefully one that will generalize to any form of modeling exercise one could undertake for determining sample sizes/power as well as add to my capacity for performing simulations. As modeling becomes more complex such as with hierarchical models, simulations become inevitable so this is also me setting the ground work.</p>
<p>A Power/Sample Size analysis forces you to become intimate with your expectations from data, to consider many possible analyses, while also serving as management tool for providing information for cost analysis and interim analysis (such as for clinical trials which I hope to make a general use case of). Simulations extend this capability by allowing you to include many additional variables while being able to vary the relationships you between these variables. You would not have to depend on sourcing prepackaged code for power/sample size calculations when considering different analysis as you are in full control of the data generating mechanism; you only need what may already be available to you in terms of the models you expect to run…. and also hardware specs that won’t deplete your patience.</p>
<h2 id="intuition-behind-the-technique">Intuition behind the technique</h2>
<p>Basically you create datasets, and perform the analysis you expect to do. This data generation process is guided by the knowledge sourced from your literature review so it is imperative you examine the results in detail to understand what kinds of datasets you may encounter.</p>
<p>You simulate thousands of datasets and check how well a particular sample size will capture an effect you’re either interested in or one you think exists.</p>

<p>The above animation should give an easy enough view of data generation. The data is that from two Normal Distributions that have the same variance but their mode of central tendency are typically three units apart. Now that we are able to simulate datasets, now comes the application of whatever analysis you have in mind. For our purposes a regression approach is used (brms package in R) utilizing the defaults for Bayesian estimation.</p>
<p>For these problems I make use of the ability to explicitly model the variances instead of using a pooled estimate of some kind (heterogeneous regression modeling). Even though I know that the variances are the same for the above animations, this will set the trend for the upcoming problems for dealing with unequal variances.</p>
<p>An example of the model output is as such:</p>

<p>We have two intercepts and two effect sizes. This is because there is one regression equation that models the mean of the normal distribution, and similarly there is another regression that models the variance of the normal distribution.</p>
<p>The variances are given on a log scale and must be exponentiated before we can interpret on the same scale as our data as shown below</p>

<p>The relevant information is extracted (mostly the quantiles of the posterior distribution of parameters) and then the entire process is repeated several times for any one sample size and also in our case for different group allocation schemes.</p>
<p>I am interested in the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Have we managed to recover the parameters used to generate the sample? Making sure you check for all the parameters becomes important such as in situations when you expect to have unequal variances between groups.</li>
<li>Is the length of the credible interval small enough? This is something I would discuss with a client. How much precision around the estimate would there have to be before the estimate becomes action worthy?</li>
<li>Is worth considering an unequal treatment/sampling allocation (something other than a 1:1 ratio)?</li>
<li>Is the credible interval typically positioned away from values which I would consider there to be no effect?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="on-to-the-simulations">On to the Simulations</h2>
<h3 id="problem-one">Problem One</h3>
<p>The first problem we will consider is to determine a sample size that can recover the location and scale effects given below with a credible interval length of 0.7 for the precision. The difference in means is 0.5 magnitude with the variance between the two groups being the same but over varying group allocations (1-1,1-3,1-5).</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mu_1 \sim N(2,1) 
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mu_2 \sim N(2.5,1)
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
e \sim N(0,1)
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
sigma ~ \gamma()
\]</span></p>
<p>The first useful piece of information is that for the estimated difference in the means.</p>

<p>By hovering over a particular point we have access to more information about that particular sample size.</p>
<p>Almost all samples shown have the ability to include the location effect size a minimum of 0.8 proportion of the time across all allocations. It seems that you don’t quite need to worry about detecting the effect though the uncertainty around the estimates can be so terrible as to make the estimate untrustworthy as can be seen by the wide credible intervals for the smaller sample sizes.</p>
<p>This is why we directly consider the length of the intervals. The criteria set for this simulation was that of 0.7 for the credible interval; the label of xgrouptwo_cover will show the proportion of times this criteria was satisfied. The 1-1 allocation first met this requirement for sample sizes 140 but was not able to maintain this for 0.8 proportion of the times until the sample size was 150 . For the 1-3 allocation these sample sizes were 188 and 200 respectively. For the 1-5 allocation the sample sizes were 246 and 246 respectively. Even though the length of the interval may be precise, what if it actually tends to occurs near values for which we dismiss the effect size as non-existent. This may not be of concern for larger effect sizes say those greater than 1, but as what you are trying to detect becomes smaller, the proximity to the zero value can become concerning. Of course bayesian estimation gives the probability of an interval around the zero value so this alleviates the concern to some extent. Even so this is a problem I’ve noticed with some power analysis in that it gives the minimum sample size needed to reject the Null Hypothesis, for which in this case it would be the sample size needed to exclude zero from the interval. The problem is that zero isn’t exactly that far from the interval when using that sample size, thus you would have to be extremely precise in your prediction of the true variability if you were to take that sample size at face value.</p>
<p>Therefore one might also consider for what sample size does the lower bound of the credible interval tend to be above a constant for example 0.1; for the 1-1 allocation this first occurs at 120 and it was not able to maintain this for 80% of the times until a sample size of 150 ;for 1-3 allocation this happened at sample sizes 140 and 208 respectively; for 1-5 allocation at 198 and 348 respectively.</p>
<p>The next informative parameter is that of the scale effect. It is important that this is captured well as this will decide whether your data is too noisy to even begin to interpret what you gathered. Remember that for this situation the variances are the same so we expect this scale effect parameter to be zero.</p>

<p>All samples shown have the ability to include the scaleeffect size a minimum of 0.7 proportion of the time across all allocations.</p>
<p>The length of the intervals. The criteria set for this simulation was that of 0.7 for the credible interval; the label of sigma_xgrouptwo_cover will show the proportion of times this criteria was satisfied. The 1-1,1-3 and 1-5 allocations met this requirement for sample sizes 60 , 80 , and 108 respectively.</p>
<p>Since this estimate is centered around zero, I let the length of the interval serve as the limit for upper and lower bounds of the estimate.</p>
<p>Thus in summary the following table details for each allocation the sample size requirements if we want the following to be satisfied at least 80% of the time:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>location effect to be captured.</p></li>
<li><p>location effect credible interval to have a length less than 0.7</p></li>
<li><p>location effect credible interval lower bound to be above 0.1</p></li>
<li><p>scale effect credible interval to have a length of 0.7</p></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="problem-two">Problem Two</h3>
<p>Now we will consider a problem that deals with a larger location effect size but with the complication of unequal variances.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mu_1 \sim N(2,1) 
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mu_2 \sim N(2.5,2)
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
e \sim N(0,1)
\]</span></p>
<p>For this problem we will not be calculating the sample size requirements as you will see it would require simulations for total sample sizes that exceed 400. Instead we will compare how the gains over the allocations compare to each other across the different criteria.</p>
<p>The first criteria of selection will be the proportion of times we were able to detect the estimate. You may recall this went well for the first problem and there does not seem to be a poor performance in the plot below.</p>

<p>The 1-3 allocation seems to be performing slightly better than the 1-5 allocation across all sample sizes. This difference seems to decrease as the sample sizes increase. Overall it would be better to use the 1-3 allocation. Interestingly the variance for group two is three times that of group one and so the allocation that is based on the ratio of variability works best.</p>
<p>Now the question becomes, if we know that the allocations seem to perform better, just how much better? The following graphs <strong>compares the drop in Interval length for the group two location effect size.</strong></p>

<p>We can see that early on with the smaller sample sizes the gain is quite large with the 1-3 allocation benefiting with a 0.4 reduction in the interval length. This benefit decreases over time but seems to reach an almost constant level at around 0.1 for the larger sample sizes.</p>
<p>The smaller samples for the 1-5 allocations have difficult time compared to the 1-1 allocation but similarly become more beneficial as the sample size increases while also reaching some sort of gently decreasing boundary for the larger sample sizes.</p>
<p>Will wait for more sims to give more solid numbers.</p>

<p>Although I will wait for more simulations to be run, it does seem like the 1-3 allocation seems to be higher in the proportion than most sample sizes when compared to the 1-1 allocation. It is not clear that what the pattern is for the 1-3 compared to the 1-5 allocation as these seem to have similar performance.</p>

<p>Here we see the same pattern as with the Location effect interval where the 1-1 allocation performed worse compared to the other allocations, and of the remainder the 1-3 allocation performed better.</p>

<p>The above graph gives us an idea of how much more efficient the allocations get when compared to a baseline being the 1-1 allocation. When we are seeking to estimate small effect sizes a decrease in an interval length of even 0.1 would be hugely beneficial. The 1-3 allocation has the most gains consistent over the sample sizes while the 1-5 allocation seems to initially be worse than the 1-1 allocation but does become better although not as great as the 1-3.</p>

<p>Finally we have a comparison of the credible interval length over the scale effect. That is how often was the 0.7 interval length satisfied for a particular sample size across allocations.</p>
<p>In conclusion for problem two, the unequal allocation serves to better estimate the parameters as the sample size increases. There is merit to allocation samples according to the ratio of variances between the groups with those that have a larger variance having more samples.</p>
<h3 id="problem-three">Problem Three</h3>
<p>This time we will be exploring the linear regression for which we will have a grouping variable with different variances across the groups and also an additional parameter that introduces linearity to the dataset.</p>
<p>To start things off the below is an animation giving a rough idea of what kinds of data sets we are talking about.</p>
<center>
<div class="layout-chunk" data-layout="l-body">
<p><img src="monte-carlo-power-analysis-independent-two-sample-difference-of-means_files/figure-html5/unnamed-chunk-19-1.gif" /><!-- --></p>
</div>
</center>
<p>We have two groups; the red points you will notice a thinner band compared to the blue points which are likely to be more spread out. This is the consequence of the unequal variances of the two groups. We are basically saying that the linear relationship exits within both groups but it applies to the members of group one more than those of group two.</p>
<p>We have two different location effects at work here. One due to the binary variable represented by the blue and red points while the other is a continuous variable represented by the X axis. As before we only consider a situation where the variability differs across the binary variable; you can imagine that we could have also considered the variance changing across the continuous variable that would result familiar patterns such as the funnel/cone shape when the equal variance assumption is not satisfied across the continuous variable.</p>
<p>For those interested in the model:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
Y_i \sim N(\theta_i,\sigma_i) \ \  \ \ \ for \ i \ from \ 1 \ to \ n
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\theta_i =  \beta_1 + \beta_2*Variable_{group} + \beta_3*Variable_{continuous}  
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\sigma_i = \beta_4 + \beta_5*Variable_{group}  
\]</span></p>
<p>Both of the parameters for the population probability distribution are modeled linearly using predictors; in this way we can account for how the variances change across the two groups and avoid the assumption of homoscedasticity altogether. The probability distributions of the beta parameters are not specified.</p>
<p>Now comes the variation that will be introduced across the parameters. Below are the graphs that give the range of the estimates that we want to use to create samples. We need a range for the <span class="math inline">\(\beta_2,\beta_3\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta_5\)</span> as these are the effect sizes that will determine the respective linear equations for the mean and variance of the population distribution. Again this information will be sourced from a combination of your literature review and your own subject matter knowledge about what may be happening.</p>

<p>For the continuous effect and group location effects we simulate both from normal distributions that have means 0.6 and 0.5 respectively and variances 0.2 and 0.1 respectively. The values for the difference in variance across the groups were simulated from a gamma distribution with scale and shape parameters of 1. All of the distributions were truncated as shown in the graph.</p>
<p>The purpose of the line graphs shown below is to detail the information for a range of sample sizes for further inspection. This initial look is not to draw any hard conclusions but instead provide the insight as to what sample sizes we should be focusing in on.</p>
<p>The ability to detect the location effect for the grouping variable is first shown.</p>

<p>For almost all samples we have a detection probability that is above 0.9 so as described before, we do not have to worry much as to whether we will recover the population parameter within the credible intervals. We notice that the 1-2 allocation maintains an almost steady detection probability of at least 0.95.</p>
<p>However when we consider the precision, the noise around the estimate may give us quite large credible intervals thus we may want to collect a larger sample to gain a certain level of precision. The next graph shows us how the interval length of the location effect changes across the different sample sizes.</p>

<p>The problem with the smaller sample sizes being so noisy with the large interval lengths is that those intervals may allocate a considerable amount of probability to regions where we know is quite far from the true effect size we planned it. We resolve this issue by thinking about what interval length that if achieved, we would be confident enough to make decisions using the estimate. If we consider having the length to be 0.7, and assuming that the estimator converges to the average true value of 0.5 then we are essentially saying that the interval of values 0.15 to 0.85 is good enough consider the effect real and actionable. You may of course require much greater precision for your own purposes but as you can see this will require quite large sample sizes. The good news is for this problem a 1-1 allocation isn’t necessary to achieve this level of precision. This may help with costs as it may be very expensive to sample from one group compared to the others. If the group where you can sample at low cost from the group requiring the two members then this will amount to considerable savings.</p>
<p>For this problem we will consider the 1-2 allocation as a cost calculation is not considered here. It would seem that we should investiate the sample sizes between 350 to 370 to achieve our goal.</p>
<p>The next two graphs desribe what happens with the scale effect size for the group variable. This effect size is responsible for the difference in variability noted earlier in the animation where the blue points were varying about its regression line more than the red points. Similar considerations as to the detection and interval length are considered for this problem.</p>

<p>It should be noted that it seems to require a much smaller sample to pick up the scale effect size. This is because it is actually quite larger than the location effect size. The mean of the gamma distribution it is simulated from is one, thus is twice as large. It makes sense that a larger effect requires a much smaller sample size to detect.</p>
<p>The sample size requirement has not increased. A smaller sample size of about 190 may capture the group scale effect but it would not capture the group location effect. Thus we still maintain the sample needed as before.</p>
<p>Finally for the initial set we consider the continuous variable location effect.</p>

<p>What is interesting about continuous effect sizes, is that even though the size isn’t that much larger than the group effect size, small sample sizes are able to get really precise intervals on the estimate. The variability of the betas are directly affected by how much variation is covered in the predictors; the larger the variation the better the estimates. This is basically saying that if you are able to collect information from a broad range of your continuous variable then this means you have more information contained in your predictor variable and this is reflected in the calculation of your continuous effect size.</p>
<p>In the simulations we have assumed a random sample was taken over some arbitrary range. You should take another look at the animation and notice that we always seems to have values spread out across a consistent range.</p>
<p>The current sample size assumption will easily satisfy the detection and interval length criteria for the continuous effect size.</p>

<p>Comment on the early, mid and late game behaviour of the allocations. It seems like the efficiency of the 1-1 is good early on but it eventually gets overtaken by the 1-2, then the 1-3 allocations. Nevmind they occupy the same regions with over-lapping confidence bands. So there are some benefits to knowing this, is that if there is a cost differential for getting items, where items from group two is cheaper to sample from, there is a point, once the sample becomes larger enough the 1-3 allocation would give you the same precision (slightly better) than having to maintain the 1-1 allocation driving costs up.</p>
<p>So next we will consider only sampling from the 1-2 allocation and add on some additional requirements that we would want the estimate to have.</p>
<p>The next informative parameter is that of the scale effect. It is important that this is captured well as this will decide whether your data is too noisy to even begin to interpret what you gathered. Remember that for this situation the variances are the same so we expect this scale effect parameter to be zero.</p>

</div>
<p>It seems that just about any sample size in the set we have considered manage to get a good precision as well</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Similar conclusions as for the location effect sizes seem to hold for the scale effect size.</p>
<p>This raises a question as to whether post hoc power/sample sizes should be carried out. Some places advise against this but the initial power analysis is carried out under fictional circumstances imagined by the analyst to be the best representations of expected reality. How then are they to know that once the data is collected the same envisioned situations cover the dataset that has materialized. Care has to be taken with the differences due to variances that are present among groups; are power analysis usually complex enough to cover situations where differences in variances require more data to establish effect sizes.</p>
